Hello there - glad to see you're interested in contributing!

This is a personal project and I bet that it'll be used by other hobbyists, so I am more than happy to support adding your pull request that...
 - Explains what you're adding/removing/changing
 - Passes test cases
 - Doesn't expand the project beyond its intended scope
